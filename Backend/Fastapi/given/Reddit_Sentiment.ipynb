      "Comment: Okay so i have my new lenovo yoga 9i with me right now and I have to charge it. There are two \"thunderbolts\" and one usb type c. One thunderbolt port has a lightning arrow icon and the other one has a lightning arrow AND a plug icon. The USB C has none, which one should I use to charge my laptop? Does it make a difference? My laptop charger has this yellow coating (?) on the inside of its metal tip if that helps.\n",

Windows 11 originally started crapping out giving green vertical lines down the screen after 5 minutes of use, so I decided to try out Ubuntu. The install worked fine, but whenever I use ubuntu after 5 minutes or so the machine crashed (screen turns off, fans are spinning and power LED is on). The only way to get the display back on is to drain flea power and then it yields the same result. Is my graphics card dead or dying, or is it some driver issue across both Windows and Linux?  \n",

      "Comment: Not sure if anyone else has experienced this after the last Synapse 3 update? The mouse and keyboard used to sync up to whatever color I had set up in the software but now only the keyboard syncs up. The mouse is the Naga Trinity. It goes through a transition effect almost as if it wants to sync up but then it just starts spectrum cycling. However, if I go in the lighting and change it to quick effect and then back to advanced effects it syncs up perfectly.\n",

I've also tried different USB ports for shits and giggles, but nothing. Uninstalling the mouse drivers too. I'm pretty positive this is software-related and not hardware related as on rare occasions the startup RGB syncs without issue, but then after a short time it desyncs and  I have to disable and re-enable advanced effects. Not really looking for a fix as I have no issue with opening Synapse and making the change real quick. Just wondering if anyone has experienced the same issue within the past few days and if so, were you able to fix it?\n",

This makes everything unplayable as when I go to move left in a game with the left thumbstick, it opens up the menu.  Anyone else seen this or have any other suggestions?

Question is, ive found an ad selling a 3070 Ti for 300$ and i just wondering if it would fit in the case, despite how big the case is, the inside is relatively small, and would a 7800x support 64 gb of ram if i theoretically decided to upgrade them?
