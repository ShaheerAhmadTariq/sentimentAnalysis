While it was running PugetBench, the M2 Max machine’s fans were so loud that people across the office were coming over to see what was going on. I would not have wanted to be typing at that time — the top of the keyboard was toasty. I only saw this during PugetBench — it was not at all loud or hot during everyday Chrome usage — but the M1 Max machine, by contrast, was astonishingly silent and cool all throughout my testing period.*\n\nThat’s very concerning.

While the M1 mini supports HDMI 2.0, I noticed that it had some gnarly color banding once HDR was enabled, which suggests it didn’t have enough bandwidth to fully support HDR over HDMI. Not even my Intel Macs had that problem.\n\nI ended up forgoing HDR on that Mac, even though its DisplayPort support didn’t have that problem, because I need HDMI for both audio and video. My external speakers use HDMI, and they sound much better than the internal speaker.\n\nI’m happy to report the new M2 Pro Mac mini fixes this problem with the HDMI, in addition to adding full support for HDMI 2.1, including VRR on day one. Not even PS5 owners got that.\n\nFirst, I tried HDMI 2.0. 4K/60Hz/HDR. No color banding. Okay, encouraging.\n\nThen, I tried HDMI 2.1. 4K/VRR/HDR. No problems whatsoever. And even if I didn’t turn on VRR, 120Hz works as well. Superb.\n\nI’ve tried two games so far. Bugsnax, despite running in Rosetta, runs at a solid 4K/70 FPS. Myst, a native game, also ran at 4K/~70 FPS with ultra settings; it would probably draw even faster if I decreased the internal resolution a little. The M2 Pro GPU is so much better than those Radeon Pros that shipped with the Intel Macs.\n\nIt’s quiet, too. I’ve pounded mine with CPU- and GPU-intensive tasks, and not once have I heard it make noise.\n\nSo yeah, even with the compromised SSD on the base model, I can recommend it over the M1 if you have a display that supports HDR, or you play games on your Mac.\n\nThis is with the M2 Pro. I know the non-Pro M2 doesn’t support HDMI 2.1 according to Apple, but what I don’t know is if it fixes the M1’s color banding problem with HDR over HDMI. Does anyone, and if so, then does it fix it or not?"},{"description":"Welcome!\n==\n\nWelcome to r/Apple, the unofficial community for Apple news, rumors, and discussions.

It was a total impulse buy.\n\nIts pretty nice, but Im kind of struggling with finding a use for it. I love how quiet it is, but the performance relative to my PC is nothing impressive. If it was a laptop I can see how the M2 chip would be so impressive, but as a desktop Im struggling to see the value. \n\nIt doesnt have HDMI 2.1, so media isnt great. Display scaling on MacOS sucks if you dont have an Apple display. Its fine running at native resolution on my 48\" 4k OLED, but on my 16\" 2560x1600 display, theres no reasonable scaling option. It defaults to 1280x800, which is like... 2004.\n\nThis is my first time using Ventura. Mission Control... I dont despise it, but it is kind of dumb looking on my 48\" display. System Settings, I definitely despise that.\n\nGaming is horrible on it too, of course. I didnt buy it for that but it was interesting to try.\n\nIm probably going to return it unless theres some amazing mac app that wins me over or I find a fun use for it as a server or something."},{"description":"Welcome!\n==\n\nWelcome to r/Apple, the unofficial community for Apple news, rumors, and discussions.

You have no idea how close I was to an XPS 13, but ultimately the M1 and airdrop were what swayed me. \n\nGlad they did. It’s been a year and I’ve never had an app drop. I’ve never seen a buffer-wheel, it’s never been warm even and the few times I pushed it, fuckin thing ate up the tasks like it was nothin. \n\nIf you can find a new M1 Air for the $799 they have been going for it’s worth it. If you’re a streamer/writer thing will last another decade. It’s single core performance is still pretty neck and neck with the M2 even. \n\nStill though, my fav pet of this thing is the display.

Its been like that for a decade with certain Mac GPUs for a decade, but there were workarounds. On M1 there is no workaround.\n\nThe HDMI port is effectively unusable unless youre using it exclusively to watch video. And even then only if youre using a modern TV with extensive video processing hardware to convert analogue video to digital.\n\nIf youre just using a standard computer display where YPbPr is only there to avoid a \"no signal\" screen with a miss-configured PC... you definitely do not want to touch the HDMI port on an M1 Mac, and probably not an M2 one either.\n\nBy the way, the M1 Mac Mini can only drive a single display over Thunderbolt/DisplayPort. If you want two displays, you have to use HDMI. And YPbPr.\n\nI was issued an M1 Mac Mini a couple weeks ago when I started a new job. Im tempted to ask my boss to buy a secondhand Intel Mac just so I can use it until the M2 Mac Mini is available in my country... but unfortunately theyd want me to use the Intel Mac for longer than a month.

Another thing that really stands out is the wireless I/o, I’ve never had better wifi on anything. The Bluetooth is insane too.. I have some old ass Bose with BT4.2 I think and I could walk from my apartment to my car til I’d would starts crackling and I’d remember I still had them on. Some newer one with bt5.3 I bet would be like a good distance further. \n\nI also don’t get audio lag on video.. if that makes sense. These headphones on a OnePlus 8 I think it was I’d get that out of sync audio on YouTube and streaming apps. Never had that happen once in any Apple shit. \n\nIf you don’t have one already, one of the newer (2018+) iPad pros make a great setup. iPhone + iPad Pro + MacBook and you’re pretty much set. Just don’t buy a MacBook if you a dirty person or like to game.. cause crumbs and nasty shit will crack the screen when you shut it. \n\nI could talk about how good apple has been doing since like 2017 for hours dude.

I just ordered a new M2 Max Macbook Pro anyhow so I think Ive spent enough for a bit. Tech advancements are just slowing down now as weve kind of gotten to peak computer for most people.
